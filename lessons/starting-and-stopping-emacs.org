** Starting Emacs

To start =Emacs=, simply type =emacs= at any prompt.

** Stopping Emacs

Any time you want to stop =Emacs=, type =c-x c-c=. You will be prompted to type =yes= if you want to stop =Emacs= or =no= if you want to continue to work in =Emacs=.

If any files are still open and work is unsaved, you will be prompted to decide whether to keep your changes. Type =y= to save your work or =n= to discard it.
